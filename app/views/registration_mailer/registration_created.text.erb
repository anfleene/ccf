Hi <%= @user.name %>,

You have successfully registered for <%=@event.title%> (<%=event_url(@event, subdomain: @event.organization.subdomain) %>). The event will run <%=@event.pretty_dates%>. In the mean time, you can submit, vote, and volunteer for project ideas at <%=event_url(@event, subdomain: @event.organization.subdomain)%>.

Check back to the site (<%=root_url(subdomain: @event.organization.subdomain)%>) for event updates and other announcements as the event approaches.

##Get Prepped

There's no reason to wait for <%=@event.title%> to get started. If you plan to volunteer on a project (<%=event_url(@event, subdomain: @event.organization.subdomain) %>), you can start discussing the project now and asking questions. It's a good idea to do a little bit of research on the project's issue - find out why the issue exists, who's impacted, and what is already being done about it. Search the internet for tools that could be helpful to use or improve upon.

It will be helpful to have a Google Account (https://myaccount.google.com/intro), so you can store project documents in Google Drive. If you're a programmer, be sure you have a GitHub account (http://github.com), and are familiar with git (https://openhatch.org/missions/git). 

Looking forward to building with you,
Your Friendly <%=@event.title%> Hosts
